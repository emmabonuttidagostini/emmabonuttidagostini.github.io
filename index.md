I'm Emma Bonutti D'Agostini, PhD Candidate in Sociology at [CREST](https://crest.science) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and [mÃ©dialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr) (Sciences Po Paris). Welcome to my personal website!

My research lies at the intersection of sociology of journalism and political sociology. In my doctoral dissertation, I study the mainstreaming of far-right voices in French and Italian legacy media, borrowing tools from CSS and NLP and combining them with qualitative sociological methodologies.

I have the chance of working alongside inspiring people - such as my supervisors, [Etienne Ollion](https://ollion.cnrs.fr) (CREST) and [Sylvain Parasie](https://sylvainparasie.org) (mÃ©dialab).

Previously, I completed a Research Master in Sociology at [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/fr/), a Bachelor Degree in Political Sciences at [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/it) and [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it), and a Bachelor Degree in Classical Piano at the [Conservatory of Udine](https://www.conservatorio.udine.it) (because, why not).

## Research Interests

My work is interdisciplinary, and I frequently collaborate with researchers in political science and computer science. Cross-cutting themes in my work include journalistic deontologies and practices; populist radical right politics; political communcation in hybrid media systems. Throughout my research, I also reflect about how we can leverage CSS to shed new light on classic sociological questions.
