I'm Emma Bonutti D'Agostini, PhD Candidate in Sociology at CREST (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and mÃ©dialab (Sciences Po Paris). Welcome to my personal website!

I have the chance of working alongside inspiring people - such as my supervisors, [Etienne Ollion](https://ollion.cnrs.fr) (CREST) and [Sylvain Parasie](https://sylvainparasie.org) (mÃ©dialab).

My research focuses on sociology of journalism and political sociology. Throughout my work, I like to borrow from the toolbox of CSS and of qualitative sociology. 

Previously, I completed a Research Master in Sociology from Sciences Po Paris, a Bachelor Degree in Political Sciences at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and University of Pisa, and a Bachelor Degree in Classical Piano at the Conservatory of Udine (why not).

## Research Interest

In my research, I study the mainstreaming of far-right voices in French and Italian legacy media. This brings me to reflect about:
* journalists' role conceptions, professional deontology, and practices
* the relations between political-electoral trends and journalistic work
* how we can leverage CSS to shed new light on classic sociological questions.

## News

ðŸŒŸ My first academic paper is forthcoming on *[Journalism](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jou)*!

ðŸŒ† I have received an Alliance Doctoral Mobility Grant to visit Columbia University in the Spring semester 2026.

ðŸ“š I will soon attend [IC2S2 2025](https://www.ic2s2-2025.org) in Sweden, and present a cool method to automatically extract quotes from newspaper content.
