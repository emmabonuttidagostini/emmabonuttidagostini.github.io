## Quote Erat Detectendum (Q.E.D.). A Computational Analysis of Reported Speech in News Media.

With Etienne Ollion and Guilhem Sicard, I have developed a ML pipeline to automatically extract quotes from French newspaper content, leveraging sequence labeling and seq-2-seq models. We have also developed an English version of the model. 
We have presented this method at IC2S2 2025 in Sweden in July 2025. We are currently finalizing a paper documenting this methodology and preparing a GitHub repository. Stay tuned for more updates!


## Mediated Voices

In my dissertation, I explore the circulation and mainstreaming of political discourse in French and Italian legacy media looking at how journalists quote politicians' statements in their articles. 
I am currently working on a paper where I explore to what extent we can explain quote volume trends observed in French national newspapers for different party families as a function of these parties' electoral trajectories and presence in French political institutions. 
Stay tuned for more updates!
