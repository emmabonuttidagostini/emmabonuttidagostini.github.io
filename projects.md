## Quote Erat Detectendum (Q.E.D.)

With Etienne Ollion and Guilhem Sicard, I have developed a ML pipeline to automatically extract quotes from French newspaper content, leveraging sequence labeling and seq-2-seq models. 
We are currently writing up a paper documenting this methodology, preparing a GitHub repository, and adapting our workflow to English. 
We will present this method at IC2S2 2025 in Sweden in July 2025. Stay tuned for more updates!


## Giving a Voice to the Far Right

In my dissertation, I explore the mainstreaming of far-right voices in French and Italian legacy media looking at how journalists quote politicians statements in their articles. 
I am currently working on a paper where I explore to what extent we can explain quote volume trends observed in French national newspapers for different party families as a function of these parties' electoral trajectories and presence in French political institutions. 
Stay tuned for more updates!
